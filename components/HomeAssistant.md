# Home Assistant

## Why
After doing some initial investigation into Home Assistant I started thinking about Use Cases where it could add value. Initially this started with problem the most basic and common use case "I want to turn a light on & off". From there it expanded to where I know use Home Assistant to control when and also by how much I charge my Electric Car and also house battery. These later two use cases are not only convenient but they will also help significantly reduce our costs on electricity as well as ensuring we do not over charge either thereby preserving, to some degree the batteries State of Health (SoH). The "things" that I use Home Assistant to connect to can be broken down in to 3 disticnct catagories:

1. Smart Devices that are connect via WiFi. These are devices such as Smart Sockets and Smart Relays
2. Zigbee Devices that either capture senor data or control relays.
3. Internet hosted services that either provide sensor information or expose services (eg. EV Climate Control)

I have found Home Assistant provides a lot of the Out of the Box Functions as well as a plethora of 3rd party add on's that extend it even further. One of the most beneficial Add On's is the Node Red component that has proved to be both an excellent Rapid Application Design (RAD) tool as well as a more production like execution engine too.
